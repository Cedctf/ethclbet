## üöß Problems

- **Fragmented Liquidity** ‚Äì Liquidity and pricing are spread across multiple prediction market platforms, making it difficult to compare and find the best opportunities.  
- **Privacy and Trust Concerns** ‚Äì Public smart contracts expose betting strategies and allocations, reducing user privacy and potentially giving competitors an advantage.  
- **Complex Calculations** ‚Äì Optimally allocating a budget across platforms with different market models (order books, AMMs, LMSRs) requires advanced calculations beyond most users‚Äô capabilities.

## üí° Inspiration

Our team actively participates in prediction markets, and we kept running into three recurring frustrations:

1. **Market hunters** waste time hopping between platforms to find the best liquidity and odds.  
2. **Privacy-conscious bettors** hesitate to reveal their strategies on public ledgers.  
3. **Casual users** struggle with the math needed to spread bets optimally across different market types.  

> ‚ÄúWhat if you could see every market in one place, privately calculate the best split, and place all your bets in a single, secure transaction?‚Äù

That question sparked our project: the invisible layer connecting all major prediction markets while keeping users‚Äô strategies private.

## üîë The Solution

- **Unified Market Aggregation** ‚Äì Aggregate events details such as title, prices, liquidity, and market depth from multiple prediction market platforms into a single interface through subgraphs.  
- **Private & Secure Betting** ‚Äì Use Oasis Sapphire smart contracts and SIWE authentication to keep bet allocations and strategies private, viewable only by the user.  
- **Intelligent Optimization** ‚Äì Leverage an LLM hosted on Oasis ROFL to match equivalent prediction markets and calculate the optimal allocation of funds across platforms to maximize returns.  
- **Automated Execution & Settlement** ‚Äì Place bets, track market resolutions, and update user balances automatically through secure smart contract workflows.
